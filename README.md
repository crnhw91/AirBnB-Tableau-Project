# AirBnB-Tableau-Project

## Scenario

You are going on vacation to New York City and will be hiring an Airbnb. To optimise your vacation, you will examine the Airbnb listings in New York City data to find patterns and identify cost-effective Airbnb listings.
Goal: Make create a data exploration dashboard to discover cost-effective locations for your vacation stay.

## Data Exploration Dashboard

Here is a link to my data exploration dashboard [link](https://public.tableau.com/views/AirBnBDataExplorationDashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). First I added a section for the different types of Airbnb listings, so you can decide what kind of listing you want. Then I create a map so you can decide the location of where you want to stay. After that I made a chart to show the ratings of the Airbnb's in that area. Lastly I made a scatter plot to compare the average price to the average rating of the Airbnb listings.

I create this from the following data.[airbnb.xlsx](https://github.com/crnhw91/AirBnB-Tableau-Project/files/11053645/airbnb.xlsx)
